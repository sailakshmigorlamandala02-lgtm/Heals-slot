# TODO for Admin Backup Feature Update

- [ ] Modify the 'backup' feature in admin.js to display a table of patient appointment details instead of JSON dump.
  - [ ] Fetch appointments data.
  - [ ] Create a table with columns: Patient Name, Doctor Name, Date, Time, Reason, Status.
  - [ ] Populate the table with appointment data, handling cases where patient or doctor might be unknown.
- [ ] Test the updated backup feature in the admin portal to ensure it displays correctly.
